&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left; font-style:italic; font-size:16px; padding:0px;&#34;&gt;How did &amp;#35;MeToo alter the cost of collaboration between women and men? I show junior female academics start fewer projects after &amp;#35;MeToo. A decrease in collaborations with new male co-authors at the same institution largely explains the decline in projects. The decrease is more pronounced when sexual harassment policies are less clear, in universities with more (public) incidents of sexual harassment, and when amended Title IX regulations (2020) are less favorable towards the accused. This is consistent with men managing a higher perceived risk of sexual harassment accusations as a potential explanation for the decrease in collaborations. Overall, &amp;#35;MeToo appears to bring unintended consequences that impact the career opportunities of junior women. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left; font-style:italic; font-size:16px; padding:0px; color:navy;&#34;&gt;Note&amp;#58; While I have not pre-registered the study, I am providing the access to the original time-stamped (unsuccessful) grant proposal for this study (dated June, 9 2021).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Appointing Charity Directors in Response to ESG Incidents</title>
      <link>https://marinagertsberg.github.io/research/esg_directors/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 10 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://marinagertsberg.github.io/research/esg_directors/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left; font-size:16px; padding:0px;&#34;&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; This paper examines how companies respond to negative ESG incidents by appointing directors with experience in charitable organizations. We find that firms are more likely to make such appointments following ESG incidents, especially when these incidents attract substantial media attention or involve social issues. The market responds positively to these appointments. We further provide evidence that firms genuinely leverage the expertise of charity directors to enhance their ESG performance, rather than appointing them for ESG window dressing. These directors are often assigned to committees overseeing ESG issues, and their appointments are associated with a higher likelihood of implementing ESG-linked compensation policies and a reduction in future incidents, particularly those related to community and workforce issues. This decrease in future incidents is primarily driven by non-overboarded directors. Overall, our findings emphasize the tangible value that charity-experienced directors bring to companies when they need to address ESG concerns.

      <title>The Disciplining Effect of Status Evaluator Status Attainment and Observed Gender Bias in Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://marinagertsberg.github.io/research/evalutions/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 19 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

&lt;p style=&#34;color:darkred; text-align:center; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;&#34;&gt;Management Science (2021)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left; font-size:16px; padding:10px;&#34;&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; We theorize that status awards will have a disciplining effect on evaluators, changing how they evaluate. Specifically, status awards will lead evaluators to place less weight on unreliable indicators of candidate quality, such as gender. We test this theory using data from restaurant evaluations on Yelp, focusing on the relationship between an evaluator’s restaurant rating and their reporting of being served by a man or a woman in their review text. We use Yelp’s evaluator status award (“Elite”) to analyze whether observed gender bias in the star ratings given to restaurants decreases after an evaluator receives this status award. We find that evaluators rate restaurants more similarly after receiving the award, regardless of whether they report being served by a man or a woman. Status awards in our context close the gender gap in restaurant ratings by 56.5% (a 0.07 stars improvement out of an initial rating gap of −0.13 stars). This reduction in gender bias is mostly due to a decrease in the number of extremely low (1 star) ratings in reviews that reference female servers. Research on status and evaluations has mostly focused on how evaluators react to increases in candidate status. We demonstrate the importance of evaluator status as a mechanism for decreasing observed gender differences in evaluations.
